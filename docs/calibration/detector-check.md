# Detector check: our tactic tags against the lichess puzzle themes

Our coach detectors (`backend/crates/review-server/src/coach/detect/`) were tuned only against
Chess.com's coach on 142 games from one account ([`coach-log.md`](coach-log.md)). This is the
independent check of [`coach-analysis.md`](../coach-analysis.md) §8 item 1: run them on lichess
puzzles, whose themes are labelled independently of us, and report precision and recall per theme.
The target was precision ≥ 0.9 on fork, pin, skewer, hanging piece and discovered attack.

**Summary.**

- Seven detector bugs were fixed (§4).
- Fork now meets the target: what the coach says is a lichess fork 95% of the time (was 65%).
- Skewer, pin and discovered attack rose to 0.71–0.88 against the lichess labels; hanging piece is
  unchanged at 0.86 (0.78 on the random set). They stay below 0.9 against those labels, but the
  labels are narrower than the tags. By hand,
  10/10 printed skewer, 10/10 hanging-piece, 9/10 pin and 7/10 discovered-attack "false positives"
  are the motif, and are what wins the material (§6).
- Chess.com agreement did not drop; it rose. Bad moves 39.2% → 40.5% exact, good moves 58.3% →
  58.8%, Blunders 138 → 140 of 228, best-move sentence unchanged at 46.0%, labels unchanged at
  68.7% (§5).

## 1. Data and sample

- **Database:** `lichess_db_puzzle.csv.zst` from <https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles> (CC0),
  downloaded 2026-10-21 (307,234,795 bytes). It stays outside the repository, in WSL
  (`~/work/lichess-puzzles`).
- **Filter:** NbPlays ≥ 100 and Popularity ≥ 50, to drop puzzles whose themes few players have
  voted on. 4,808,704 puzzles pass.
- **Strata:** 300 puzzles at random from each of 14 themes, plus 10,000 at random from the whole
  database:
  - fork, pin, skewer, hangingPiece, discoveredAttack, doubleCheck, trappedPiece;
  - backRankMate, mateIn1, mateIn2, attraction, deflection, capturingDefender, promotion.

  Reservoir sampling, seed 20261021. The strata overlap a little: 14,190 distinct puzzles, of which
  14,131 were checked.
  59 were skipped: their solution is longer than the 12 plies the coach reads from a line.
- **Committed:** only the ids, [`tools/calibrate/puzzle_ids.tsv`](../../tools/calibrate/puzzle_ids.tsv)
  (id and strata). `puzzle_check.py sample --from-ids` rebuilds the identical sample from the
  database (checked byte for byte). The FENs and moves quoted in §7 are lichess data (CC0).

Precision is given twice:

- on the whole sample, which is rich in the 14 themes;
- on the 10,000 random puzzles alone ("random"), the unbiased estimate.

## 2. What is measured

A lichess puzzle is the opponent's move (the first of `Moves`) and then the solution: the solver's
moves and the forced replies. The example `puzzle_tags` (review-server) plays the opponent's move
and reads the solution as a line, the way `coach/circ.rs` reads an engine line. A line that ends in
mate gets `mate_in` from its length, as an engine mate score would give it.

Three readings:

| reading | what it is | coach code |
|---|---|---|
| **said** (MISSES) | The one event the coach says for the line as a best move: a mate, else the highest-priority tactic behind the material the line wins, at any solver move up to the gain (WINS_MATERIAL on the first move, LEADS_TO later), else a tactic of the first move. | `circ::line_event` with `Circ::Misses` |
| **permits** (PERMITS) | The same line as the reply that the opponent's move allowed: a tactic is named on the first move only (or the second after a quiet check), plus the free-piece rules of `circ::permits`. | `circ::permits` |
| **fired** | Every tactic any detector finds on any solver move. | `detect::tactics` |

"Said" is what a user reads, so it carries the targets. "Fired" shows the detectors on their own.

### Mapping of lichess themes to our tags

| lichess theme | our tags | note |
|---|---|---|
| fork | `fork`, `royal_fork` | |
| pin | `pin`, `exploits_pin` | lichess tags a pin only when it stops an attack or an escape |
| skewer | `skewer` | lichess tags a skewer only once the piece behind is taken |
| hangingPiece | `free_piece`; `free_piece:hanging` | `free_piece:hanging` is the like-for-like subset: a non-pawn taken undefended |
| discoveredAttack | `discovered_attack`, `discovered_check` | |
| doubleCheck | `double_check` | |
| trappedPiece | `trapped_piece` | |
| backRankMate | `back_rank_mate` | |
| mateIn1 | `checkmate` (said); `checkmate`, `back_rank_mate` (fired) | |
| mateIn2–5 | `forced_mate` (said) | fired: the mating move of any mate is `checkmate` (theme `mate`) |
| attraction | `attraction` | |
| deflection | `overloaded` | closest only: our overloaded defender takes back and drops the other piece |
| capturingDefender | `removes_defender` | |
| promotion | `promotion` | |

Our `free_piece` is wider than lichess's hangingPiece:

- it counts pawns;
- it counts pieces that are defended too little to be won back;
- it never counts taking back on the square where the opponent just captured.

Lichess counts a recapture as hanging when the opponent's capture took less than the piece it puts
there.

## 3. Results (said, MISSES)

**Recall per theme (said):** the share of the theme's puzzles where the coach says one of its tags.

| lichess theme | puzzles | before | after | why the rest is missed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| fork | 1,979 | 0.73 | 0.73 | a free piece taken by the forking move is said first (FreePiece outranks Fork) |
| pin | 1,081 | 0.29 | 0.32 | mates and other tactics outrank it |
| skewer | 550 | 0.61 | 0.73 | |
| hangingPiece | 732 | 0.50 | 0.50 | mates said first; taking back is never a free piece for us |
| discoveredAttack | 944 | 0.55 | 0.56 | |
| doubleCheck | 402 | 0.21 | 0.14 | most double-check puzzles are mates, said as mates |
| trappedPiece | 423 | 0.84 | 0.84 | |
| backRankMate | 695 | 0.19 | 0.19 | a longer mate is `forced_mate` whatever its last move (by design) |
| mateIn1 | 1,950 | 0.73 | 0.89 | the rest are `back_rank_mate` |
| mateIn2 | 2,086 | 1.00 | 1.00 | |
| attraction | 921 | 0.13 | 0.19 | the fork or mate it sets up is said |
| deflection | 916 | 0.01 | 0.02 | no tag of ours means deflection |
| capturingDefender | 383 | 0.39 | 0.50 | |
| promotion | 582 | 0.37 | 0.47 | |

**Fired** (every detector on every solver move), precision after (before) on the whole sample:

- fork 0.70 (0.41), skewer 0.46 (0.34), pin 0.68 (0.44), discovered attack 0.63 (0.55);
- free_piece:hanging 0.91 (0.91), back_rank_mate 0.74 (0.38), removes_defender 0.52 (0.10).

Recall when fired: fork 0.98, skewer 0.95, trapped piece 0.92, discovered attack 0.82, hanging
piece 0.77, pin 0.61. The detectors find almost every lichess fork and skewer somewhere in the
line. The lower numbers when said are mostly priority between tags, not detection.

**Permits** (the reply line; tactics named on its first move only), after (before):

- fork 0.95 (0.70), skewer 0.86 (0.60), pin 0.74 (0.64);
- discovered attack 0.77 (0.70), free_piece:hanging 0.78 (0.78).

## 4. What was wrong, and the fixes

Each fix follows chess semantics. Each has a unit test in `tests/coach_detect.rs`.

1. **Back-rank mate** (`detect/mate.rs`): the mate counted when every square in front of the king
   was covered by the attacker or held by its own pieces, with at least one own piece. That called
   a queen-and-rook mate with one pawn in front a back-rank mate.
   - Now every square in front must hold one of the king's own pieces.
   - Said precision 0.26 → 0.64.
2. **Fork** (`detect/double.rs`): an undefended pawn counted as a fork target. So a check that also
   hits a loose pawn was called a fork.
   - Now pawns never count.
   - Said precision 0.65 → 0.95.
3. **Discovered attack** (`detect/double.rs`): a target that can simply take the uncovered piece
   (an unguarded attacker, or a cheaper one) was counted. For example, a recapture opens a file and
   the rook at the end of it just takes ours.
   - Now such targets are dropped, using the legal replies, so a check or pin that stops the
     capture still counts.
   - Said precision 0.67 → 0.76, recall unchanged.
4. **Pin** (`detect/lines.rs`): pins of pawns were said as the tactic behind the material. In a
   first, smaller sample (6,169 puzzles), 12 of the 15 pawn pins said carried no lichess pin.
   - Now pawns are skipped. A pinned pawn that cannot take back is still `exploits_pin`.
   - Said precision, with fixes 5 and 7: 0.53 → 0.76.
5. **Skewer** (`detect/lines.rs`): the detector was static, so it fired when the front piece could
   interpose, or when the line did something else.
   - Now, when the line goes on, the front piece must step off the line and the mover must take the
     piece behind on its next move. A line that ends right after the skewer still gets it.
   - Said precision 0.60 → 0.88.
6. **Removes defender, overloaded** (`detect/defender.rs`): both were static ("the guarded piece can
   now be won"). They fired on almost any capture of a defender, 0.04 precision on the random set.
   - Now the line must win the guarded piece with one of the mover's next two moves.
   - For overloaded, the defender must take back first.
   - Removes defender: said precision 0.19 → 0.67.
7. **The capture that settles the gain** (`circ.rs`, `Tag::threatens_material`): a fork, pin, skewer
   or discovered attack made by the capture that completes a line's gain was named as the reason for
   that gain. The fork made by the last capture of a deflection line is one example. That capture
   is now explained by what it takes, so the earlier move's tactic, or MaterialGain, is said.
   Applied only when the gain is not on the first move.

**Not changed (definitions differ, not bugs):**

- `free_piece` keeps pawns and defended-too-little pieces, and never counts a recapture.
- A longer mate stays `forced_mate`.
- We have no deflection tag.
- FreePiece still outranks Fork when one capture does both. This is the main fork recall gap; see
  §8.

## 5. Chess.com agreement (run `coach-detector-check`)

Measured on the 142 calibration games at commit `cac2d14`, the same way as `coach-main-582bdd9`
(Stockfish 18, depth 18, MultiPV 3). Both runs read the same engine results from a local disk cache
of the server's engine pool (a patch that is not committed). The coach is pure, so only engine
results are cached and the tags are what a fresh search gives.

| | main `582bdd9` | this branch | change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| bad moves exact (1,641 plies both apps label bad) | 643 (39.2%) | 665 (40.5%) | +22 |
| good moves exact (5,349) | 3,116 (58.3%) | 3,144 (58.8%) | +28 |
| Blunders exact (228) | 138 | 140 | +2 |
| opening-phase bad, report style (602) | 34.4% | 35.5% | |
| best-move sentence (exact) | 46.0% | 46.0% | |
| label agreement | 68.7% | 68.7% | |

Per ply, 100 plies became exact and 48 stopped being exact.

- **Gains:**
  - a pinned pawn no longer said as a pin: Chess.com says the development, defence or recapture;
  - removes-defender lines now said as the trade;
  - back-rank mates now plain checkmates.
- **Losses:** 7 PERMITS forks of a king and a loose pawn (now material gain), and a few forks now
  said as the positional idea. Chess.com calls some king-and-pawn checks forks; lichess and the
  textbook do not.

## 6. Checked by hand

Precision against lichess undercounts, because lichess labels only some of the motifs that are
there:

- skewer only once the piece behind is taken;
- pin only when it stops an attack or an escape;
- back-rank mate not when the mating piece also covers a square in front;
- hanging piece with its own exclusions, and with themes crowd-voted.

To estimate real precision, the ten printed "false positives" of each target tag were checked by
hand. They are a random draw from each list; all are listed in §7.

| tag | real motif, and what wins | real but incidental | wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| fork | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| hanging piece (`free_piece:hanging`) | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| skewer | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| pin | 9 | 0 | 1 (doubtful: the pinned rook may take the pinner along the line) |
| discovered attack | 7 | 3 | 0 |
| back-rank mate | 10 | 0 | 0 |

Counting only the first column as right, real precision is estimated as the lichess precision plus
the share of its false positives that were real:

- fork 0.95 + 0.05 × 10/10 ≈ 1.0;
- skewer 0.88 + 0.12 × 10/10 ≈ 1.0;
- hanging piece 0.86 + 0.14 × 10/10 ≈ 1.0;
- pin 0.76 + 0.24 × 9/10 ≈ 0.98;
- discovered attack 0.76 + 0.24 × 7/10 ≈ 0.93.

Only discovered attack still names an uncovered attack that is not what wins, 3 of 10 times. With
10 cases per tag these are estimates, not measurements.

## 7. Examples

Each table is a random draw of ten from the list in its heading. The FEN is lichess's: the
position before the opponent's move. The moves are UCI: the opponent's move first, then the
solution. Themes are lichess's, without the length, phase and evaluation themes. "We say" is the
coach's event: tag, circumstance chain and the solver move (ply) it is on.

## 8. Follow-ups

- **FreePiece and Fork on one capture.** When a capture takes a free piece and forks, the free piece
  is said even when the line wins more (e.g. `NRG6v`: Bxc5 takes a loose knight and hits Re7 and the
  king). It is most of the fork recall gap (13% of the fork stratum). Changing it is a priority
  change, so it needs its own Chess.com measurement.
- **Discovered attack that is not the point.** 3 of 10 checked cases name a real uncovered attack
  while the material comes from elsewhere. Requiring the uncovered piece (or the moved one) to take
  the target in the line, as skewer now does, would remove them.
- **Exploits pin** is said at 0.48 against lichess pin and was not checked by hand.
- **Deflection** has no tag of ours. `overloaded` covers only the "defender takes back" form.

## 9. How to repeat

In WSL, with the database outside the repository:

```
python3 tools/calibrate/puzzle_check.py sample --db ~/work/lichess-puzzles/lichess_db_puzzle.csv.zst \
    --out ~/work/lichess-puzzles/sample.jsonl --from-ids tools/calibrate/puzzle_ids.tsv
cargo build --release -p review-server --example puzzle_tags      # in backend/
python3 tools/calibrate/puzzle_check.py run --sample ~/work/lichess-puzzles/sample.jsonl \
    --out ~/work/lichess-puzzles/tags.jsonl
python3 tools/calibrate/puzzle_check.py report --sample ~/work/lichess-puzzles/sample.jsonl \
    --tags ~/work/lichess-puzzles/tags.jsonl --out ~/work/lichess-puzzles/report.md
```

`run` reads the example from `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR` (or `--binary`). It takes under a second for the
14,190 puzzles; `sample` takes about 30 s. Without `--from-ids`, `sample` draws a new sample
(`--per-theme`, `--random`, `--seed`) and `--ids` writes its ids. The report draws its own ten
examples per list, so they differ from the ones checked by hand above.
